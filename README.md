## Introduction
• We designed a Physical mobile robot which has the ability to perform simple tasks such as line following wall following to Advanced task such as line maze solving  
• Simulation robot could line follow, segmented wall follow, dotted line follow, colour detect, obeject pick & place, climb through ramps and search, identify chess pieces positions on a board and perform a checkmate.


## Features

To complete the quest the robot needs to have these major skills. 
 Physical skills  
I. Surface detection  
II. Color sensing  
III. Object lifting  
IV. Ramp Climbing  

Algorithmic skills  
I. Line/Dotted line following  
II. Height/ Depth or distance calculation  
III. Proper path selection  

So our goal is to empower the robot with these skills efficiently, accurately and precisely in order to complete without failures.

Unfortunatetlty we couldn't have footages on the final implementation of achieving the tasks



## Learning_Outcomes

- Identify the composition of a basic robot system and explain the functionality of each component.
- Select suitable sensors, actuators, mechanisms, and a power source for a simple robot design to perform a given task.
- Design and build a small robot and its control system for the required functionality.
- Tune, test and troubleshoot the robot to achieve best performance.
- Demonstrate teamwork and collaborative efforts to achieve a common goal and complete a task in the given time frame.
